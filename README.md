# Agent Based SIR Model to model the spread of Pink-eye disease in Cattle

Pink Eye is a common disease that spreads in cattle and greatly affects their market price. This simulation models how the disease spread when cattle are kept in 6 adjacent farms and one of them is infeted in one farm. Furthermore, the cattle graze (modeled by 2-D random walks) in the farm to gain weight, and upon reaching a set value of weight, they move to a salebarn, where they are sold and kept in a Stocker where they again gain weight and upon reaching another set value of weight, they are again sent back to the salebarn and sold again and kept in feedlots. They again graze and gain weight and upon reaching yet another set value of weight, they are finally sent to an abattoir. The disease can spread all this while when the cattle is traveling. Also, it is assumed that the cattle become immune after recovery from the disease.
